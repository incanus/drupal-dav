NOTE: This is experimental software meant for advanced users; assume nothing
works, and you may be pleasantly surprised. And when it breaks, you get to
keep both pieces.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
This module requires Drupal 6.x and PHP 5.2.x (or newer). Additional PEAR
library requirements are detailed below.

____________
To use the DAV server, you MUST have the prerequisite PEAR
HTTP_WebDAV_Server package [1] installed.

Due to licensing differences, PEAR packages can't be distributed directly
with Drupal modules. However, provided your server has the PEAR command line
tools available, HTTP_WebDAV_Server is easy enough to install. On Unix-like
servers, just run the following command as root to install the package and
make it available system-wide:

  # pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Server

On older PEAR versions, you may instead need to specify the explicit package
URL as follows:

  # pear install \
      http://download.pear.php.net/package/HTTP_WebDAV_Server-1.0.0RC4.tgz

Failing system-wide installation (if you're on a shared server, for
instance), you can manually download the package from [1] and install the
files locally in your Drupal instance as follows (you only need these four
files, and they must be installed with the shown paths):

  modules/dav/includes/HTTP/WebDAV/Server.php
  modules/dav/includes/HTTP/WebDAV/Tools/_parse_propfind.php
  modules/dav/includes/HTTP/WebDAV/Tools/_parse_proppatch.php
  modules/dav/includes/HTTP/WebDAV/Tools/_parse_lockinfo.php

____________
To enable the included DAV client support, which allows PHP applications
(including other Drupal modules) to use the "webdav://" and "webdavs://"
protocol stream wrappers [2], you MUST have the PEAR HTTP_WebDAV_Client
package [3] installed.

Again, provided a properly working PEAR environment, installation is simple:

  # pear install HTTP_WebDAV_Client

Or, on older PEAR versions:

  # pear install \
      http://download.pear.php.net/package/HTTP_WebDAV_Client-0.9.7.tgz

Manual installation would proceed similarly as for the DAV server (see
above), but involves several preliminary PEAR dependencies (at least
HTTP_Request, Net_URL, Net_Socket) and is left as an exercise for the
reader.

____________
[1] http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_WebDAV_Server/ (1.0.0RC4 or later)
[2] http://php.net/stream
[3] http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_WebDAV_Client/ (0.9.7 or later)
[4] http://pear.php.net/package/HTTP_Request/


INSTALLATION
------------

  1. Copy all the module files into a subdirectory called modules/dav/
     under your Drupal installation directory.

  2. Go to Administer >> Site building >> Modules and enable the DAV API
     and DAV FS modules.

  3. Go to Administer >> Site configuration >> DAV settings to review and
     change the configuration options to your liking (e.g. enable the DAV
     server).
